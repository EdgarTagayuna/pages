        <h1>Monster Encounter: Slime Monster</h1>
        <h2>
            As you walked deeper into the pathway, you could hear slimy noises inside the walls. From afar, you saw blue, viscous substance seeping out <br>
            from the crevices of the wall and of the floor. Gradually, it formed into a huge, translucent blob. It was blocking the path. However, it didn't seem to be <br>
            harmful until it shot out a slimy substance, grazing the edges of your sleeves. You noticed that it had acidic properties, causing them to be damaged. <br>
            It kept firing, but you evaded them with ease. What will you do now, traveler?
