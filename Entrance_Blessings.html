        <p>Welcome, traveler. Perhaps you do not realize the dangers that will unfold climbing this tower.</p>
        <p>The challenges when scaling this tower led to the demise of other young souls such as yourself.</p>
        <p>Many vengeful spirits, monsters, beasts, and demonic foes will stand in your way from reaching the top.</p>
        <p>I would suggest you turn back now for your own good.</p>
        <p>But if you truly wish to ascend, pick up the sword of bravery, and enter the tower. May the heavens be on your side.</p>
