        <h2>
            Continuing forward, the footsteps are getting closer and closer. When you look behind you, there is nothing there. <br>
            However, the hissing sounds are getting louder and louder. As you look behind, mist started forming from where you were. It was cold.<br>
            As you exhaled, you could see your breath forming. The torches from the wall were put out one by one. It was as if <br>
            darkness itself was slowly creeping in. Amidst the darkness from afar, you could see a girl with skin pale as paper. <br>
            She was clad in a white robe with her long, black hair, covering her face. Barefooted, she took a step, causing the flames of <br>
            of the torches to be put out. The mist followed her, as the hissing gets louder and louder. What will you do now, traveler?
