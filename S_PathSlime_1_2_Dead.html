        <h1>The demise of the Swordsman</h1>

        <h2>
            The blessing completely dissolved inside its body. Reduced into nothingness inside the monster. Hurdling towards you,<br> 
            it was over in an instance. The huge gelatinous hand took hold of you. Completely engulfing your body with slime. With its vice-like grip, you could not move. The acidic element it possessed slowly melts away your skin.<br>
            You could feel your face slowly peeling away with a burning sensation. It slowly eats away at you, feeling the excruciating pain for what felt like an eternity. Until there was nothing left of you.
        </h2>

        <p>I warned you, didn't I? It was foolish of you to climb this tower.</p>
