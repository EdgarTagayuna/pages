        <h1>Young Swordsman</h1>

        <h2>
            As the slime hurdling towards you, what you didn't expect was the huge hand started expanding <br>
            to an incredibly massive size till it exploded, covering you in a slimy, acidic substance. The acidic element it possessed slowly melts away your skin.<br>
            You could feel your face slowly peeling away with a burning sensation. It slowly eats away at you, feeling the <br>
            excruciating pain for what felt like an eternity. Until there was nothing left of you.
        </h2>

        <br>
        <p>I warned you, didn't I? It was foolish of you to climb this tower, and yet why do you persist?</p>
