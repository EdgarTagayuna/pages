        <h1>Ascending to the second floor</h1>
        
        <h2>
            You made your way up the stairs. When you reached the second floor you are greeted <br>
            by a very long hallway. It was dark. The deeper you go in, the darker it became. Until a certain point, where a hint of light shone at the end of the tunnel <br>
            As you ventured through it, you are then greeted by three pathways. One leads straight to another corridor. <br>
            To your left and right, there stood different pathways that led to somewhere. Where will you go traveler?
