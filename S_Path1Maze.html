        <h1>Traversing the Tower</h1>

        <h2>
            As you made your inside the tower, there were torches lit up on each side of the wall. <br>
            Looking straight ahead, you are greeted by a very long hallway. It was dark. The deeper you go in, the darker it became. <br>
            As you ventured through it, you are then greeted by three pathways. One leads straight to another hallway. <br>
            To your left and right, there stood different pathways that led to somewhere. Upon listening for a bit, <br>
            you hear odd noises from the left path. Where will you go traveler?
