        <h1>Evading masterfully</h1>

        <h2>
            You noticed that although it was hurdling towards the left, the slime appendage had a sort of curvature. It curved, and headed towards <br>
            your right at a great speed. It was so fast, that it didn't have enough to curve back towards where you're at, landing <br>
            on the ground with force great enough to destroy the stone tiled floors. Farther ahead inside the tower, you noticed that there is <br>
            a pathway that leads upwards. Just as you head there,  the slime monster's hand immediately lunges toward you yet again from the right. <br>
            The trajectory path seemed linear.
