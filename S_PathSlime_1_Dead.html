        <h2>
            The blessing completely dissolved inside. Reduced into nothingness inside the monster's body.<br> 
            it was over in an instance. The huge gelatinous hand took hold of you. Completely engulfing your body with slime. With its vice-like grip, you could not move. The acidic element it possessed slowly melts away your skin.<br>
            You could feel your face slowly peeling away with a burning sensation. It slowly eats away at you, feeling the excruciating pain for what felt like an eternity. Until there was nothing left of you.
        </h2>

        <br>
        <p>You are far to young a soul to lose your life this early. It is quite unfortunate. </p>
